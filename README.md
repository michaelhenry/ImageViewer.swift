## Installation

Using [cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org)

```ruby
pod 'ImageViewer.swift', '~> 3.0'
```

## How to use it

The simplest way to to use this is by using the [UIImageView.setupImageViewer()](https://github.com/michaelhenry/MHFacebookImageViewer/blob/master/Example/Demo/BasicViewController.swift#L11)


```swift
imageView.setupImageViewer()
```

Example:

```swift
import ImageViewer_swift

let imageView = UIImageView()
imageView.image = UIImage(named: 'cat1')
...
imageView.setupImageViewer()
```

Or you might load it from a URL

```swift
imageView.setupImageViewer(url: URL(string: "https://example.com/image.jpg")!)
```

Or you might load it with an array of images `[UIImage]`

```swift
let images = [
	UIImage(named: "cat1"),
	UIImage(named: "cat1"),
	UIImage(named: "cat1")
]
imageView.setupImageViewer(images: images)
```

Or you might load it with an array of URL `[URL]`

```swift
let urls = [
	URL(string: "https://example.com/your-image-1.jpg")!,
	URL(string: "https://example.com/your-image-2.jpg")!,
	URL(string: "https://example.com/your-image-3.jpg")!
]
imageView.setupImageViewer(urls: urls)
```

You could also check the [Demo](Example) Project for more information.
